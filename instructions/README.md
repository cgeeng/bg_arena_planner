* Explore the use of streams in Java
* Practice reading and writing files in Java


## Instructions


### :fire: Task 1: Design 

Before you start writing, it is important to think about design. You DO NOT have to be perfect in your design, so we will come back to this step a few times. 

1. First, become a detective and read through the files provided - both the .csv file and the java files. Take notes on what you are seeing (such as ordering of the csv lines).  This is a common skill in software engineering, and you will need to do this often as you work with other people's code.
2. Go to [DesignDocument.md](../DesignDocument.md) and fill out (ONLY) the initial design section.

> [!TIP]
> You are free  to use mermaid or any other UML tools you want, just make sure if you are using another UML tool, you properly link the image in the markdown file. See the resources page, for a list of [UML tools](https://github.com/CS5004-khoury-lionelle/Resources?tab=readme-ov-file#uml-design-tools).


### :fire: Task 2: Implement by Test Driven Development

After your initial design, you should seek to follow the TDD process. This means you should write tests first, and then implement the code to pass those tests. Or better stated, you should write *ONE* test first, implement, and repeat until you have written all your tests. 

1. Figure out a number of tests by brainstorming (done in design)
2. Write **one** test
3. Write **just enough** code to make that test pass
4. Refactor/update  as you go along
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have all the tests passing/fully built program

Note: you often don't know all the tests as you write. As such, it is alright to continue to expand your list. This is where people get stuck on TDD. They think they have to know **all** the tests before they start. You don't. You just need to know the next test, and then at the end you double check you have covered all code paths and have full coverage. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure to commit as you development. The bare minimum commits would be after every test, but you probably will have additional commits especially at the beginning.

### :fire: Task 3: Finish Design Document

By this point, your design has probably changed (very few people have perfect designs the first iteration). Update your design document with the final design in the "final design" section. We want to see the history of your first design to your final design. That is a good thing. 


### :fire: Task 4: Finish Report.md

Inside of [Report.md](../Report.md) you will need to answer a series of questions about your program, and about the learning objectives for the module in general. Fill it out. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> A primary purpose of this activity is to get you working through a process in addition to writing code. In software engineering the process you follow is often just as important as the code you write. This is because the process is what allows you to work with others, and to be able to maintain and update code over time. It may seem tedious right now, but it is a skill that will pay off in the long run.




## Submission

When you are completed, you need to submit your code to gradescope. Go back to Canvas, and click through the link that takes you to the Gradescope assignment. When you submit, you will actually need to pull from your github repository in the dialog that appears. It only pulls the most recent submission, and if you make an update to the repository after you submit, you will need to resubmit to get the latest version in gradescope. 


## 📝 Grading Rubric

1. Learning (AG)
   * Code compiles without issue
   * Code passes all tests 
2. Approaching (AG)
   * Passes the style check.  
3. Meets (MG)
  * README.md is filled out (name, github repo, etc) 
      * With out the link to your repo, the TAs won't grade the rest!
   * DesignDocument (INITIAL) sections are filled out 
   * All methods are tested with JUnit tests
   * Method contain proper javadoc comments (not just javadoc notation but proper wording in the comment)
   * Report.md technical questions are questions answered correctly.
4. Exceeds (MG)
   * Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
      * Including making use of helping/utility classes to reduce duplication.
   * Student uses proper inheritance without duplication 
   * Methods include tests for edge cases in addition to happy path
   * Proper use of sorts and sort strategy
   * Design document (FINAL) sections are filled out 
     * The notation needs to be correct, and the TAs will double check the final design
     matches the final implementation.
   * Report.md Deeper Thinking question filled out
     * Includes at least two references/citations

Legend:
* AG - Auto-graded
* MG - Manually graded

### Submission Reminder 🚨
For manually graded elements, we only guarantee time to submit for a regrade IF you submit by the DUE DATE. Submitting late may mean it isn't possible for the MG to be graded before the AVAILABLE BY DATE, removing any windows for you to resubmit in time. While it will be graded, it is always best to submit by the due date, so you have full opportunity to improve your grade.

If you need a reminder about the grading policy, please review the syllabus and the canvas page on 'formative/summative' grading. This class uses a unique grading system that will allow you to be flexible with due dates and multiple resubmissions (if you submit with time for TAs to give feedback), but we also ask that you continue to work on the assignment until you get a full grade.


### Autograder Limitation
Currently the autograder is limited in how it can test. As such, when it comes across an error it just stops. This means that if you have multiple errors in your code, you may only see the first one. We are working on improving this, but for now, you will need to fix the first error, and then rerun the tests to see the next error. Eventually, if every test passes, you will get the single point. It also may give you points for valid style, while errors exist in the code - so really assume the first 2 points are done together.
